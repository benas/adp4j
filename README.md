## What is Easy Properties?

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/j-easy/easy-props](https://badges.gitter.im/j-easy/easy-props.svg)](https://gitter.im/j-easy/easy-props?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Easy Properties is a library to inject configuration properties in Java objects declaratively using annotations. Let's see a quick example. Suppose you have an object of type `Bean` which should be configured with:

* An Integer property `threshold` from a system property passed to the JVM with `-Dthreshold=100`

* A String property `bean.name` from a properties file named `myProperties.properties`

To load these properties in the `Bean` object using Easy Properties, you annotate fields as follows:

```java
public class Bean {

    @Property(source = "myProperties.properties", key = "bean.name")
    private String beanName;

    @SystemProperty(value = "threshold", defaultValue = "50")
    private int threshold;

    //getters and setters omitted

}
```

and instruct the library to inject these properties in the annotated fields:

```java
//Instantiate your object
Bean bean = new Bean();

//Create a PropertiesInjector and inject properties in your object
aNewPropertiesInjector().injectProperties(bean);
```

That's it! Easy Properties will:

* introspect the `Bean` instance looking for fields annotated with `@Property` and `@SystemProperty`
* convert each property value to the target field's type
* and inject that value into the annotated field

You can also configure your object at construction time:

```java
public class Bean {

    @Property(source = "myProperties.properties", key = "bean.name")
    private String beanName;

    @SystemProperty(value = "threshold", defaultValue = "50")
    private int threshold;

    public Bean () {
        aNewPropertiesInjector().injectProperties(this);
    }

    //getters and setters omitted

}
```

Now just create your object and it will be configured and ready to use.

**Without** Easy Properties, you would write something like this:

```java
public class Bean {

    private int threshold;

    private String beanName;

    public Bean() {

        //Load 'threshold' property from system properties
        String thresholdProperty = System.getProperty("threshold");
        if ( thresholdProperty != null ) {
            try {
                threshold = Integer.parseInt(thresholdProperty);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                // log exception
                threshold = 50; //default threshold value;
            }
        }

        //Load 'bean.name' property from properties file
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        try {
            InputStream inputStream = this.getClass().getClassLoader()
                        .getResourceAsStream("myProperties.properties");
            if (inputStream != null) {
                properties.load(inputStream);
                beanName = properties.getProperty("bean.name");
            }
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            // log exception
            beanName = "FOO"; // default bean name value
        }

    }

    //getters and setters omitted

}
```

As you can see, a lot of boilerplate code is written to load just two properties, convert them to the target field type, etc. Easy Properties takes care of all this boilerplate with a couple of intuitive annotations, which makes your code cleaner, more readable and maintainable.

In this quick example, you have seen two types of properties sources (system and resource bundle).
Easy Properties can inject properties from many other sources like databases, JNDI contexts, and more.

Even better, Easy Properties allows you write your own annotations and inject properties from a custom configuration source.

## Why Easy Properties?

Dependency injection frameworks allow you to inject properties in Java objects and they do it well.

But in order to benefit from this feature, your code should run inside a DI container, or at least, the object in which you are trying to inject properties must be managed by a DI container.

What if your code does **not** run inside a DI container? This is where Easy Properties comes to play, to allow you to benefit from properties injection **without** requiring your code to run inside a DI container.
